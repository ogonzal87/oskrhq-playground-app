          <strong>Text XSmall. </strong>I must explain to you how all this
          mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
          will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
          teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
          human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
          because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
          pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
          painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
          obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
          circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
          pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
          laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
          But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
          pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
          that produces no resultant pleasure?
